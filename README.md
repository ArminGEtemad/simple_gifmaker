# simple_gifmaker
a simple gifmaker written in python, because I didn't want install a software to just make videos into gifs. 
That is all!
If anyone ever stumble upon this repo you can just use this program like:

```bash
python make_gif.py "path to video.mp4" --start 0.0 --end 20.0 --width 420 --loop 0 --output "path for gif.gif"
```
